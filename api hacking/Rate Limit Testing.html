<h1>Rate Limit Testing</h1>

<p>Rate limiting is a restriction on the number of requests an API consumer
can make within a given time frame. It is enforced by an API provider’s web
servers, firewall, or web application firewall and serves two important pur-
poses for API providers: it allows for the monetization of APIs and prevents
the overconsumption of the provider’s resources. Because rate limiting is an
essential factor that allows organizations to monetize their APIs, you should
include it in your scope during API engagements.</p>
<p>For example, a business might allow a free-tier API user to make one
request per hour. Once that request is made, the consumer would be kept
from making any other request for an hour. However, if the user pays this
business a fee, they could make hundreds of requests per hour. Without
adequate controls in place, these non-paying API consumers could find
ways to skip the toll and consume as much data as often as they please.</p>
<p>Rate limit testing is not the same as denial of service (DoS) testing. DoS
testing consists of attacks that are intended to disrupt services and make the
systems and applications unavailable to users. Whereas DoS testing is meant
to assess how resilient an organization’s computing resources are, rate
limit testing seeks to bypass restrictions that limit the quantity of requests
sent within a given time frame. Attempting to bypass rate limiting will not
necessarily cause a disruption to services. Instead, bypassing rate limiting
could aid in other attacks and demonstrate a weakness in an organization’s
method of monetizing its API.</p>
