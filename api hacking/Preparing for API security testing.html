<h1>API Security</h1>

<p>API security testing does not quite fit into
the mold of a general penetration test, nor
does it fit into that of a web application pen-
etration test. Due to the size and complexity of
many organizations’ API attack surfaces, API penetra-
tion testing is its own unique service.</p>
<p>API penetration testing requires a well-developed scope, or an account
of the targets and features of what you are allowed to test, that ensures the
client and tester have a mutual understanding of the work being done.
Scoping an API security testing engagement comes down to a few factors:
your methodology, the magnitude of the testing, the target features, any
restrictions on testing, your reporting requirements, and whether you plan
to conduct remediation testing.</p>
  <h2>Receiving Authorization</h2>
  <div><p>Before you attack APIs, it is supremely important that you receive a signed
contract that includes the scope of the engagement and grants you authori-
zation to attack the client’s resources within a specific time frame.
For an API penetration test, this contract can take the form of a signed
statement of work (SOW) that lists the approved targets, ensuring that you
and your client agree on the service they want you to provide. This includes
coming to an agreement over which aspects of an API will be tested, deter-
mining any exclusions, and setting up an agreed-upon time to perform
testing.</p>
<p>Double-check that the person signing the contract is a representative
of the target client who is in a position to authorize testing. Also make sure
the assets to be tested are owned by the client; otherwise, you will need to
rinse and repeat these instructions with the proper owner. Remember to
take into consideration the location where the client is hosting their APIs
and whether they are truly in a position to authorize testing against both
the software and the hardware. Some organizations can be too restrictive with their scoping docu-
mentation. If you have the opportunity to develop the scope, I recommend
that, in your own calm words, you kindly explain to your clients that the
criminals have no scope or limitations. Real criminals do not consider
other projects that are consuming IT resources; they do not avoid the sub-
net with sensitive production servers or care about hacking at inconvenient
times of day. Make an effort to convince your client of the value of having
a less-restrictive engagement and then work with them to document the
particulars. Meet with the client, spell out exactly what is going to happen, and then
document it exactly in the contract, reminder emails, or notes. If you stick
to the documented agreement for the services requested, you should be
operating legally and ethically. However, it is probably worth reducing your
risk by consulting with a lawyer or your legal department.</p></div>
