<h1>Auditing API Documentation</h1>

<p>An API’s documentation is a manual that describes how to use the API and
includes authentication requirements, user roles, usage examples, and API
endpoint information. Good documentation is essential to the commercial
success of any self-sufficient API. Without effective API documentation,
businesses would have to rely on training to support their consumers. For
these reasons, you can bet that your target APIs have documentation.
Yet, this documentation can be riddled with inaccuracies, outdated
information, and information disclosure vulnerabilities. As an API hacker,
you should search for your target’s API documentation and use it to your
advantage. In gray box and white box testing, an API documentation audit
should be included within the scope. A review of the documentation will
improve the security of the target APIs by exposing weaknesses, including
business logic flaws.</p>
