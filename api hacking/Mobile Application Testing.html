<h1>Mobile Application Testing</h1>

<p>Many organizations have mobile applications that expand the attack sur-
face. Moreover, mobile apps often rely on APIs to transmit data within the
application and to supporting servers. You can test these APIs through
manual code review, automated source code analysis, and dynamic analysis.
Manual code review involves accessing the mobile application’s source code
and searching for potential vulnerabilities. Automated source code analysis
is similar, except it uses automated tools to assist in the search for vulner-
abilities and interesting artifacts. Finally, dynamic analysis is the testing of
the application while it is running. Dynamic analysis includes intercepting
the mobile app’s client API requests and the server API responses and then
attempting to find weaknesses that can be exploited.</p>
