<h1>Security Testing Cloud APIs</h1>

<p>Modern web applications are often hosted in the cloud. When you attack
a cloud-hosted web application, you’re actually attacking the physical serv-
ers of cloud providers (likely Amazon, Google, or Microsoft). Each cloud
provider has its own set of penetration testing terms and services that you’ll
want to become familiar with. As of 2021, cloud providers have generally
become friendlier toward penetration testers, and far fewer of them require
authorization submissions. Still, some cloud-hosted web applications and
APIs will require you to obtain penetration testing authorization, such as
for an organization’s Salesforce APIs. You should always know the current requirements of the target cloud
provider before attacking. The following list describes the policies of the
most common providers.</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) AWS has greatly improved its stance
on penetration testing. As of this writing, AWS allows its customers to
perform all sorts of security testing, with the exception of DNS zone
walking, DoS or DDoS attacks, simulated DoS or DDoS attacks, port
flooding, protocol flooding, and request flooding. For any exceptions
to this, you must email AWS and request permission to conduct testing.
If you are requesting an exception, make sure to include your testing
dates, any accounts and assets involved, your phone number, and a
description of your proposed attack.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Google simply states that you do not
need to request permission or notify the company to perform penetra-
tion testing. However, Google also states that you must remain compli-
ant with its acceptable use policy (AUP) and terms of service (TOS)
and stay within your authorized scope. The AUP and TOS prohibit ille-
gal actions, phishing, spam, distributing malicious or destructive files
(such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses), and interruption to GCP
services.
Microsoft Azure Microsoft takes the hacker-friendly approach and
does not require you to notify the company before testing. In addition,
it has a “Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement” page that spells
out exactly what sort of penetration testing is permitted https://www
.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement</p>
<p>At least for now, cloud providers are taking a favorable stance toward
penetration testing activities. As long as you stay up-to-date with the pro-
vider’s terms, you should be operating legally if you only test targets you are
authorized to hack and avoid attacks that could cause an interruption to
services.</p>
