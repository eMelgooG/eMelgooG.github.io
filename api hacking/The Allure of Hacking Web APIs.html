<h1>The Allure of Hacking Web APIs</h1>

<p>In 2017, The Economist, one of the leading sources of information for international business, ran the following headline: “The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data.” APIs are digital pipelines that allow a 
precious commodity to flow across the world in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Simply put, an API is a technology that enables communication 
between different applications. When, for example, a Python application 
needs to interact with the functionality of a Java app, things can get messy 
very quickly. By relying on APIs, developers can design modular applications that leverage the expertise of other applications. For example, they no  longer need to create their own custom software to implement maps, payment processors, machine-learning algorithms, or authentication processes.</p>
  <h2>Modern applications</h2>
  <div><p>As a result, many modern web applications have been quick to adopt 
APIs. Yet new technologies often get quite a head start before cybersecurity 
has a chance to ask any questions, and APIs have hugely expanded these 
applications’ attack surfaces. They’ve been so poorly defended that attackers can use them as a direct route to their data. In addition, many APIs lack the security controls that other attack vectors have in place, making 
them the equivalent of the Death Star’s thermal exhaust port: a path to 
doom and destruction for businesses.</p>
<p>Due to these reasons, Gartner predicted years ago that by 2022, APIs 
will be the leading attack vector. As hackers, we need to secure them by 
putting on our rollerblades, strapping the Acme rocket to our backs, and 
catching up to the speed of technological innovation. By attacking APIs, 
reporting our findings, and communicating risks to the business, we can do 
our part to thwart cybercrime.</p></div>
