<title>Introduction to API penetration testing</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Imagine if sending money to a friend required more 
than opening an app and making a few clicks. Or if 
monitoring your daily steps, exercise data, and nutrition information meant checking three separate applications. Or if comparing airfares involved manually visiting each airline’s website</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not hard to imagine this world: we lived in it not too long 
ago. But APIs have changed all that. They are the glue that has enabled collaboration across companies and transformed how enterprises build and 
run applications. Indeed, APIs have become so pervasive that an Akamai 
report from October 2018 found that API calls accounted for an astounding 
83 percent of all web traffic.</p>
<p>But as with most things on the internet, if there’s something good, 
cybercriminals will take notice. To these criminals, APIs are highly fertile 
and profitable ground, and for good reason. These services offer two highly 
desirable traits: (1) rich sources of sensitive information and (2) frequent 
security gaps.</p>
  <h2>API's role</h2>
  <div><p>Consider the role APIs play in a typical application architecture. When 
you check your bank balance on a mobile app, an API behind the scenes 
requests that information and sends it to the app. Likewise, when you apply 
for a loan, an API allows the bank to request your credit history. APIs sit in a 
critical position between users and the sensitive systems on the backend. If 
a cybercriminal can compromise the API layer, they could get direct access 
to highly valuable information.</p>
<p>While APIs have reached an unprecedented level of adoption, their 
security continues to lag. I recently spoke with the chief information 
security officer of a 100-year-old energy company and was surprised 
to learn they use APIs throughout the organization. But, he quickly 
pointed out, “whenever we look under the hood, we find they are often 
over-permissioned.”</p></div>
