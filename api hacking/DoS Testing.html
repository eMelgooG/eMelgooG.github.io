<h1>DoS Testing</h1>

<p>I mentioned that DoS attacks are often off the table. Work with the client to
understand their risk appetite for the given engagement. If the customer is confident about the strength of their infrastructure and is willing to accept
the risks associated with DoS attacks. Otherwise, work with the customer to
see what they’re willing to allow.
DoS attacks represent a huge threat against the security of APIs. An
intentional or accidental DoS attack will disrupt the services provided by
the target organization, making the API or web application inaccessible. An
unplanned business interruption like this is usually a triggering factor for
an organization to pursue legal recourse. Therefore, be careful to perform
only the testing that you are authorized to perform!</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether a client accepts DoS testing as part of the scope
depends on the organization’s risk appetite, or the amount of risk an organi-
zation is willing to take on to achieve its purpose. Understanding an orga-
nization’s risk appetite can help you tailor your testing. If an organization
is cutting-edge and has a lot of confidence in its security, it may have a big
appetite for risk. An engagement tailored to a large appetite for risk would
involve connecting to every feature and running all the exploits you want.
On the opposite side of the spectrum are the very risk-averse organizations.
Engagements for these organizations will be like walking on eggshells. This
sort of engagement will have many details in the scope: any machine you
are able to attack will be spelled out, and you may need to ask permission
before running certain exploits.</p>
