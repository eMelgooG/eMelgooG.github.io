<h1>Threat Modeling</h1>

<p>Threat modeling is the process used to map out the threats to an API provider.
If you model an API penetration test based on a relevant threat, you’ll be
able to choose tools and techniques directed at that attack. The best tests of
an API will be those that align with actual threats to the API provider.
A threat actor is the adversary or attacker of the API. The adversary can
be anyone, from a member of the public who stumbles upon the API with
little to no knowledge of the application to a customer using the applica-
tion, a rogue business partner, or an insider who knows quite a bit about
the application. To perform a test that provides the most value to the secu-
rity of the API, it is ideal to map out the probable adversary as well as their
hacking techniques.</p>
<p>Your testing method should follow directly from the threat actor’s
perspective, as this perspective should determine the information you are given about your target. If the threat actor knows nothing about the API,
they will need to perform research to determine the ways in which they
might target the application. However, a rogue business partner or insider
threat may know quite a bit about the application already without any
reconnaissance. To address these distinctions, there are three basic pen-
etration testing approaches: black box, gray box, and white box.</p>
  <h2>Bug Bounty</h2>
  <div><p>Bug bounty programs often fall somewhere on the spectrum between
black box and gray box testing. A bug bounty program is an engagement
where a company allows hackers to test its web applications for vulnerabili-
ties, and successful findings result in the host company providing a bounty
payment to the finder. Bug bounties aren’t entirely “black box” because
the bounty hunter is provided with approved targets, targets that are out
of scope, types of vulnerabilities that are rewarded, and allowed types
of attacks. With these restrictions in place, bug bounty hunters are only
limited by their own resources, so they decide how much time is spent on
reconnaissance in comparison to other techniques. If you are interested in
learning more about bug bounty hunting, I highly recommend Vickie Li’s

<p>In a white box approach, the client discloses as much information as
possible about the inner workings of their environment. In addition to
the information provided for gray box testing, this might include access to
application source code, design information, the software development kit
(SDK) used to develop the application, and more. White box testing models
the threat of an inside attacker—someone who knows the inner workings of
the organization and has access to the actual source code. The more infor-
mation you are provided in a white box engagement, the more thoroughly
the target will be tested.</p></div>
