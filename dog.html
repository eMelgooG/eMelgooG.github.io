<h1>I love Manu</h1>

<p>It's time for a change. From know on I will wiggle my tail towards the north in order to make my fur more shiny so that everyone would enjoy petting me.</p>

  <h2>Is it my soulmate?</h2>
  <p>Yesterday while Manu was taking me to the park I saw the most amazing dog ever. She was incredible. Her golden, yellow fur is the most beautiful I've seen in this world. I believe she's a labrador. I need a haircut.</p>
